# Clustering of customers data with vehicles insurance policies

For this project I'm suing dataset of customers with vehicle insurance policies, which I found on kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/ranja7/vehicle-insurance-customer-data .

These socio-economic data with details about auto insurance polices of the customer can be used to for analyzing their behavior enabling targeted  marketing to offer more personalized policies to them.

In this project I will use different unsupervised learning techniques to cluster customer to better understand their behavior. The results of this project could be useful to insurance companies, because by understanding customers behavior companies can provide better services according customers needs, increase customer's satisfaction, and as a result increase companies' profit and minimize losses.
